# React base app

react-base-app provides a clean React app with some helpful libraries.
This project was set up from scratch, so the webpack.config.js can be modified without any workarounds.
This project was set up with the following libraries:
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/overview.html)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
* [Eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/)
    - based on [Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
* [React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/getting-started)
    - With a csv loader so it is easier to maintain your translations
